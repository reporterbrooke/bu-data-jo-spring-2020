An intro to github for journalists is proceeding with challenge (not as scary as it looks!)

## Markdown rules
* Readme files look great in markdown!(dress it down, or dress it up--it's up to you)
* While editing, it may look primitive, but check out the preview (wowza, very cool)

## Your edits are suggestions
* In the preview, you will see changes color coded with green and red
* Nothing is final until changes are committed
